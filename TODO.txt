- subscribe method on router 
  - takes in a path ie /tasks
  - takes in callbacks 
    - onConnect
    - onDisconnect
    - onMessage
  - adds the client to a sse map on the router

- unsubscribe method on the router
  - takes in a path ie /tasks
  - removes the client from the sse map on the router
  
- publish method on the res object 
  - takes in a path ie /tasks
  - works similarly to ctx.res.json but instead of sending a json it sends a sse event
  - client does not need to be subscribed to the path to publish
  - if the client is subscribed to the path it will receive the event
  - if the client is not subscribed to the path it will not receive the event
